    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">International Opportunities for Macedonian Medical Graduates</h3>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">Macedonian medical graduates can leverage their internationally recognized degrees to pursue opportunities abroad. Many countries have specific pathways for international medical graduates to practice, often requiring additional licensing exams or certifications. For Indian students returning to India, they would typically need to clear the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (FMGE) to practice in the country.</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc list-outside space-y-5 ps-5 text-lg text-gray-800">
        <li class="ps-2">**Europe**: Countries like Germany offer the EU Blue Card for skilled workers, which can be an option for medical professionals with a recognized degree and relevant work experience.</li>
        <li class="ps-2">**Australia and the United States**: These countries have their own assessment processes for international medical graduates, such as the Australian Medical Council (AMC) exams or the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) series.</li>
